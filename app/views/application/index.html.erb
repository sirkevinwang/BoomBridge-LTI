<h3>Configuring the Canvas Plug-in</h3>
<p>
  We designed this tool to work with any learning management tool that supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). The tool is optimized for Canvas as it is the current learning management system used at Red Cloud. BoomBridge needs to be configured with for each Canvas course. The following are instructions for loading BoomBridge as an External App in Canvas.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to your Canvas course and click on Settings > Apps > View App Configurations. Then click on “+App” to add a new External App.
	<li>
    Fill in the Name, Consumer Key, and Shared Secret as shown below. Set the Privacy to Public.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
      <li style="margin-left:2em">
        You should change the consumer key and shared secret if you have changed them on the server’s “config/lti_settings.yml” file. You can read more about this in “Code Structure” in the next section. 
      </li>
      <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
        If you have migrated from the CMU hosted server to your on-premise server, you should use the domain pointing to that server for the launch URL. For example, if your domain name is apple.com, then your new launch URL should be “https://apple.com/launch"
      </li>
      <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">
        You must set the privacy setting to Public.
      </li>
     </ol>
  </li>
	<li>Finally, click “Submit”.</li>
</ol>
