# BoomBridge

## What is BoomBridge?
BoomBridge is a Canvas plug-in that processes student-submitted Boom Cards screenshots and automatically grades the corresponding Canvas assignments. First, the teacher would create Canvas assignments using BoomBridge as an external tool for each Boom Cards deck. The student would complete the Boom Cards deck using the link posted on the Canvas assignment pages and submit a screenshot of their Boom Cards result page once they are done with a lecture. Then, the BoomBridge uses optical character recognition (OCR) to determine a grade from the screenshot, and automatically grades the assignment as well as unlocks the next lectures on Canvas.

## Documentation
You can find the documentation for the project under the `docs` folder. The "Project Documentation Package" includes the server deployment specifications, Canvas tool configuration instructions, maintenance information, as well as a privacy policy section regarding the tool's FERPA compliance. The "Final Report" is the final report the project team turned in as a part of the final deliverables submitted to the Information Systems Consulting Project course (67-373) at Carnegie Mellon University.
